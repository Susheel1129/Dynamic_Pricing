## Project Overview

**E-Commerce Pricing & Sales Insights** is a data-driven project aimed at optimizing pricing strategies in the **Japan e-commerce market**.
The objective is to **reduce margin leakage** while maintaining or increasing **GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)**. Using **simulated data** that reflects **seasonality, category-specific price elasticity, and margin constraints**, the project delivers **actionable insights** for informed decision-making.

## Key Features

* **Dynamic Pricing Engine:** Automatically adjusts prices based on competitor pricing and internal margin rules.
* **Category Discount Policy:**

  * Beauty: 40%
  * Electronics: 25%
  * Price adjustments based on category-specific elasticity.
* **Pilot Simulation Results:** +0.9% margin improvement with minimal GMV impact (-1.5% on 20% of SKUs).
* **Interactive Dashboard (Power BI):**

  * Executive Summary
  * Seasonal Impact Analysis
  * Risk Monitor & Margin Guardrails
  * What‑If Analysis & User Interactivity
* **Financial Impact Analysis:** Evaluates **gross profit, return cost, and net profit lift** for pricing decisions.
